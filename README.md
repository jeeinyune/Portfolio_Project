## Portfolio Projects
### Python

#### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis on NYPD Arrest Data

  <p style="margin:0;"><strong>Code:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/tiannaparris/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Analyzing%20the%20Factors%20Contributing%20to%20the%20Success%20of%20a%20Movie.ipynb">Analyzing the Factors Contributing to the Success of a Movie.ipynb</a></p>
  <p style="margin:0;"><strong>Description:</strong> The dataset contains over 5,000,000 records from NYC OpenData, with 18 variables including arrest key, date, borough, age group, offense description, and more. The project involves data wrangling—loading, cleaning, preprocessing, and filling missing values—to uncover trends, patterns, and insights. The analysis includes charting key arrest statistics, focusing on trends over time and demographic distributions, and creating interactive plots to drill down into specific categories of arrests and demographic information.</p>
  <p style="margin:0;"><strong>Skills:</strong> data cleaning, detecting data anomalies, data analysis, dealing with outliers, data visualization, descriptive statistics.</p>
  <p style="margin:0;"><strong>Technology:</strong> Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib.</p>
  

  #### 2. Risky Data Analysis
  **Code:** [`Analyzing the Factors Contributing to the Success of a Movie.ipynb`](https://github.com/tiannaparris/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Analyzing%20the%20Factors%20Contributing%20to%20the%20Success%20of%20a%20Movie.ipynb)
  **Description:** The project involves calculating portfolio weights, returns, and risks using MSCI indices and Treasury Bonds data, incorporating key statistical analyses. The analysis includes plotting efficient frontiers and asset classes on a risk-return graph, achieving a minimum variance of 8.1% and an equal-weighted portfolio return of 7.3%. Additionally, the project evaluates covariance and correlation matrices, identifying the highest covariance of 0.012 and correlation of 0.85. A beta analysis was conducted, with betas of 1.2 for MSCI AC WORLD and 1.3 for MSCI USA.
  **Skills:** portfolio management, statistical analysis, data manipulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, descriptive statistics, covariance and correlation analysis, risk and return analysis, mean variance optimization, efficient frontier calculation, distribution analysis, portfolio optimization, regression analysis.
  **Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Statsmodels.
